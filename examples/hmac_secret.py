Connects to the first FIDO device found which supports the HmacSecret extension,
creates a new credential for it with the extension enabled, and uses it to
derive two separate secrets.

NOTE: This extension is not enabled by default as direct access to the extension
is now allowed in a browser setting. See also prf.py for an example which uses
the PRF extension which is enabled by default.
