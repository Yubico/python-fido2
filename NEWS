* Version 2.0.0 (released 2025-05-20)
 ** See also the migration guide: doc/Migration_1-2.adoc.
 ** Python 3.10 or later is now required.
 ** WebAuthn dataclasses have been updated to align with the WebAuthn Level 3
    Working Draft. Constructors now require keyword arguments (`kwargs_only=True`),
    and serialization to/from dictionaries is compatible with standardized JSON
    formats.
 ** The `features.webauthn_json_mapping` flag has been removed, as its
    behavior (standardized JSON mapping) is now default.
 ** `Fido2Client` and `WindowsClient` constructors now accept a
    `ClientDataCollector` instance instead of `origin` and `verify` parameters.
 ** `WindowsClient` has been relocated to `fido2.client.windows`. Importing this
    class on non-Windows platforms will now raise an `ImportError`.
 ** `Fido2Client` methods now return `RegistrationResponse` and
    `AuthenticationResponse` objects, instead of raw attestation/assertion data.
 ** CTAP2/WebAuthn extension handling has been redesigned. `Fido2Client` now
    expects a list of `Ctap2Extension` instances. Default behavior includes
    extensions commonly supported by browsers.
 ** The `fido2.cbor` module's `load_x` and `dump_x` functions have been made
    private (renamed with a leading underscore) and should not be used directly.
 ** Previously deprecated functions and APIs have been removed.
 ** The `__version__` attribute in `fido2/__init__.py` has been removed. Use
    `importlib.metadata.version('fido2')` to get the package version.
 ** Building the library now requires Poetry version 2.0 or later.

* Version 1.2.0 (released 2024-11-27)
 ** Improved extension handling:
    Several new extensions are now supported, both for Fido2Client and WindowsClient.
    Extension APIs have been redesigned, and old APIs have been deprecated, slated for
    removal in version 2.0.
  *** Disable hmac-secret extension by default, preferring prf.
 ** Improved (de-)serialization of dataclasses to/from JSON-friendly dicts.
 ** Fido2Client:
  *** Support allowCredentials/excludeCredentials of arbitrary length.
  *** Handle PUAT_REQUIRED by re-attempting with PIN/UV.
 ** Allow localhost (and subdomains) to use http:// in RP ID verification by default.
 ** NFC: Support for Authenticators that return SW=61XX on SELECT.
 ** USB: Improve connection recovery and use more specific exceptions for errors.
 ** Fix: Handle residentKey=preferred properly.
 ** Fix: Handle Authentictors that do not pass extensions in GetInfo.

* Version 1.1.3 (released 2024-03-13)
 ** Fix USB HID issue on MacOS that sometimes caused a pause while waiting for a
    timeout.
 ** Fix argument to CredProp extension where an enum value was required instead of
    also allowing a string.
 ** Fix parsing of some key types (ES384, ES512) causing signature verification to fail.
 ** Deprecation: Calling websafe_decode with a bytes argument instead of str.
    This will raise a TypeError in the next major version of the library.

* Version 1.1.2 (released 2023-07-06)
 ** Fix ClientPin usage for Authenticators that do not support passing a PIN.
 ** Fix: Handle correct CTAP response codes in authenticatorSelection.

* Version 1.1.1 (released 2023-04-05)
 ** Add community provided support for NetBSD.
 ** Bugfix: Don't set length for largeBlob when offset is 0.
 ** Bugfix: Remove print statement in webauthn parsing.

* Version 1.1.0 (released 2022-10-17)
 ** Bugfix: Fix name of "crossOrigin" in CollectedClientData.create().
 ** Bugfix: Some incorrect type hints in the MDS3 classes were fixed.
 ** Stricter checking of dataclass field types.
 ** Add support for JSON-serialization of WebAuthn data classes.
    This changes the objects dict representation to align with new additions in the
    WebAuthn specification. As this may break compatibility, the new behavior
    requires explicit opt-in until python-fido2 2.0 is released.
 ** Update server example to use JSON serialization.
 ** Server: Add support for passing RegistrationResponse/AuthenticationResponse (or
    their deserialized JSON data) to register_complete/authenticate_complete.
 ** Add new "hybrid" AuthenticatorTransport.
 ** Add new AuthenticatorData flags, and use 2-letter names as in the WebAuthn spec
    (long names are still available as aliases).

* Version 1.0.0 (released 2022-06-08)
 ** First stable release.

* Version 1.0.0rc1 (released 2022-05-02)
 ** Release Candidate 1 of first stable release.
 ** Require Python 3.7 or later.
 ** APIs have updated to align with WebAuthn level 2.
 ** Several CTAP 2.1 features have been implemented.

 ** Bugfix: Linux - Don't fail device discovery when hidraw doesn't support
    HIDIOCGRAWUNIQ (Linux kernels before 5.6).

 ** Add product name and serial number to HidDescriptors.
 ** Remove the need for the uhid-freebsd dependency on FreeBSD.

* Version 0.9.1 (released 2021-02-03)
 ** Add new CTAP error codes and improve handling of unknown codes.

* Version 0.9.0 (released 2021-01-20)
 ** Server: Attestation is now done in two parts (to align better with the spec):
    First, type-specific validation is done to provide a trust chain.
    Second, validation of the trust chain is done.
 ** Client: API changes to better support extensions.
  *** Fido2Client can be configured with Ctap2Extensions to support.
  *** Client.make_credential now returns a AuthenticatorAttestationResponse,
      which holds the AttestationObject and ClientData, as well as any client
      extension results for the credential.
  *** Client.get_assertion now returns an AssertionSelection object, which is
      used to select between multiple assertions, resulting in an
      AuthenticatorAssertionResponse, which holds the ClientData, assertion
      values, as well as any client extension results for the assertion.
 ** Renames: The CTAP1 and CTAP2 classes have been renamed to Ctap1 and Ctap2,
    respectively. The old names currently work, but will be removed in the
    future.
 ** ClientPin: The ClientPin API has been restructured to support multiple PIN
    protocols, UV tokens, and token permissions.
 ** CTAP 2.1 PRE: Several new features have been added for CTAP 2.1, including
    Credential Management, Bio Enrollment, Large Blobs, and Authenticator Config.
 ** HID: The platform specific HID code has been revamped and cleaned up.

    unspecified.

 ** New fido2.webauthn classes modeled after the W3C WebAuthn spec introduced.
 ** CTAP2 send_cbor/make_credential/get_assertion  and U2fClient
    request/authenticate `timeout` arguments replaced with `event` used to
    cancel a request.
 ** Fido2Client:
  *** make_credential/get_assertion now take WebAuthn options objects.
  *** timeout is now provided in ms in WebAuthn options objects. Event based
      cancelation also available by passing an Event.
 ** Fido2Server:
  *** ATTESTATION, USER_VERIFICATION, and AUTHENTICATOR_ATTACHMENT enums
      have been replaced with fido2.webauthn classes.
  *** RelyingParty has been replaced with PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity, and
      name is no longer optional.
  *** Options returned by register_begin/authenticate_begin now omit unspecified
      values if they are optional, instead of filling in default values.
  *** Fido2Server.allowed_algorithms now contains a list of
      PublicKeyCredentialParameters instead of algorithm identifiers.
  *** Fido2Server.timeout is now in ms and of type int.
 ** Support native WebAuthn API on Windows through WindowsClient.
